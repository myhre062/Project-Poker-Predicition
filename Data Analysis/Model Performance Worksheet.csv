Model Type,Best Accuracy Performance,Accuracy (%),Optimizations,Model Notes
Linear SVC,0.4996,49.96%,None,"80%/20% train/test split
multi-class solver 'ovr' used
model only predicted class 0 (No playable hand) for all testing data"
Logistic Regression,0.5012,50.12%,"Max iteration: 30,000","High max iterations to achieve convergence
"
Decision Tree,0.6321,63.21%,None,"Reasonable precision/recall scores for classes 0, 1 (60% +)
Steep drop off in performance for remaining classes
(Scores of 35% or less for precision and recall)"
KNN,0.57,57.00%,Best k: 16,"K curve optimal k values: 6, 16
Suprising performance on class 5 (Flush: 99% recall! Only 29% precision)
Generally poor performance except for class 0 precision/recall 
(moderate performance of 75%/60%)"
Random Forest,0.7606,76.06%,None,"Estimators - 500
Successfully found at least some of classes 0 through 6
successful classes had at 350+ instances in the testing data
65%+ precision per successful class (exception: class 4, 42%)
Poor recall except for class 0, 1"
